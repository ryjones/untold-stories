This is a page that generates an episode for a podcast. It should have an audio file associated with it, specified in the file keyword above. When the site is generated the feed.xml file is updated to reflect these posts with all the details for each episode. Each page will also have an embedded player to listen to the audio in the web page.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
